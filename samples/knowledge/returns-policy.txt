Returns and Refunds Policy

All items purchased from our store may be returned within 30 days of delivery for a full refund. Items must be in their original packaging and in unused condition.

To initiate a return, customers should call our support line or visit the returns page on our website. A return shipping label will be emailed within 24 hours. Once we receive the returned item, refunds are processed within 5-7 business days to the original payment method.

Exceptions to the 30-day return policy include clearance items marked as final sale, personalized or custom-made products, and perishable goods. Digital downloads and gift cards are non-refundable.

For defective items, we offer a 90-day warranty that covers manufacturing defects. Customers can request either a replacement or a full refund for defective products regardless of their condition.

If a package arrives damaged during shipping, customers should take photos of the damage and contact support within 48 hours. We will arrange a replacement shipment at no additional cost.
