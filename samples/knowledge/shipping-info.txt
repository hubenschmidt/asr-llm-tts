Shipping Information

We offer three shipping options for domestic orders: Standard shipping takes 5-7 business days and is free for orders over $50. Express shipping takes 2-3 business days and costs $12.99. Overnight shipping is available for $24.99 with delivery by the next business day if ordered before 2pm EST.

International shipping is available to most countries. Delivery times range from 7-21 business days depending on destination. International shipping rates are calculated at checkout based on weight and destination. Customs duties and import taxes are the responsibility of the buyer.

All orders receive a tracking number via email once shipped. Tracking updates may take 24 hours to appear in the carrier's system after the shipment label is created.

For orders containing multiple items, we may ship in separate packages. Each package will have its own tracking number. There is no additional shipping charge for split shipments.

We ship Monday through Friday, excluding federal holidays. Orders placed on weekends or holidays are processed on the next business day.
